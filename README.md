## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this project is to make the webpage more useful and complete in order to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. There are more table filers added, including the city, state, country and shape in addition to the date.   

## Results:
The final webpage:

The webpage filters the table correctly based on user input, for example, you can enter "ks" in the Enter a State, you will see that the table is updated to show the reported sightings that was recorded for the state of Kansas.

Another example, you can enter "01/11/2010" in the Enter a Data, you will see that the table is updated to show the reported sightings that was recorded on 01/11/2010.

## Summary:

### One drawback of this webpage

o   The current input is not very user friendly. Users have to type the whole city or state name to show the reported sightings. In this case, dropdown list would be convienient for the user to look for the specific city or state they are interested in.

### Two additional recommendations for further development

o	It is recommended to add a click-button which can clear the results after each search.       
    
o	The data is so out-of-date and it only has information for one month in 2010. It is recommened that kepp the data updated regularly.
